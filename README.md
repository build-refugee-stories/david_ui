# Refugee Stories - Build Week Project

This repo is the files used by [Dave Inden](https://www.daveinden.com) to complete a Build Week challenge while attending [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com).

Built with Semantic HTML and CSS (preprocessed with [Less](http://lesscss.org)) to create two pages of a website.

The first page is the main landing page or marketing site to describe the project. The second is an About Us page noting the team members of those who worked to build the application.

Page is published to Github Pages and can be seen here: [build-refugee-stories.github.io/david_ui/](https://build-refugee-stories.github.io/david_ui/)
